My project is a website for a fake company that I one day hope to own.
It contains an index, about, and projects page, along with an example project
The example project can be accessed by hovering over the projects button and 
clicking on the drop down finance button. In this project I tried to create my
rendition ofa single page application using javascript to dynaically change the
page (the index, project, and about pages are all on one html file).

I originally wrote all my scripts in javascript. Then I had some free time because I finished early
so i converted the main script file to typescript, which is why theres a typescript file.

I made two responsive menus using both css and javascript one is the main navigation
menu in the upper right hand corner. The other is located at the bottom of the projects page where you can select between 
the differnt project catagories and see a description of what the company does.

I also made a simple word animation that apears when you click the words "victis technologies"
in the upper left hand corner (only works in desktop and tablet mode). you can only view this animation once,
to view it twice you need to refresh the page, and you cannot view this animation in the finance project page.

I also populated an array with values and displayed the contents on the page within
finance "sample" project. This is done within the readStock() and print() functions
in the finance.js file. I'm not 100% sure if the math in this file evaluates correctly, its pretty close if not,
but it doesn't impact the preformance or functionallity of the website.
